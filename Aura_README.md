# Aura – Humanitarian Safety Intelligence Platform

**Real-time, AI-powered field intelligence for humanitarian responders.**

Aura is an open-source platform designed to help aid workers and humanitarian teams operate more safely and effectively in crisis zones. The platform aggregates geotagged field reports, satellite imagery, social media data, and GIS feeds to deliver real-time situational awareness through AI-driven analysis and intuitive dashboards.
